    <strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the Gather app (hereby referred to as
      "Application") for mobile devices that was created by Spencer Chang
      (hereby referred to as "Service Provider") as a Free service. This service
      is intended for use "AS IS".
    </p>
    <br /><strong
      >What information does the Application obtain and how is it used?</strong
    >
    <p>
      The Application does not obtain any information when you download and use
      it. Registration is not required to use the Application. The Application
      collects your email if you choose to receive updates via email. This email
      will only be used to send you updates related to the Application.
    </p>
    <br /><strong
      >Does the Application collect precise real time location information of
      the device?</strong
    >
    <p>
      This Application does not collect precise information about the location
      of your mobile device.
    </p>
    <br /><strong
      >Do third parties see and/or have access to information obtained by the
      Application?</strong
    >
    <p>
      All data is stored locally on device by default. You may choose to sync
      with supported third party services, such as
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="https://are.na">Are.na</a>:
        <a href="https://www.are.na/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <br /><strong>What are my opt-out rights?</strong>
    <p>
      You can stop all collection of information by the Application easily by
      uninstalling it. You may use the standard uninstall processes as may be
      available as part of your mobile device or via the mobile application
      marketplace or network. You may disconnect from third party services at
      any time by logging out from them.
    </p>
    <br /><strong>Children</strong>
    <p>
      The Application is not used to knowingly solicit data from or market to
      children under the age of 13.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable
      information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to
      never submit any personally identifiable information through the
      Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourage parents and
      legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help
      enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
      personally identifiable information through the Application and/or
      Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a
      child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service
      Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the
      Service Provider (spencer@spencer.place) so that they will be able to take
      the necessary actions. You must also be at least 16 years of age to
      consent to the processing of your personally identifiable information in
      your country (in some countries we may allow your parent or guardian to do
      so on your behalf).
    </p>
    <br /><strong>Security</strong>
    <p>
      The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality
      of your information. However, since all data is stored locally, there is
      no risk of your data being accessed by unauthorized individuals.
    </p>
    <br /><strong>Changes</strong>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. The
      Service Provider will notify you of any changes to their Privacy Policy by
      updating this page with the new Privacy Policy. You are advised to consult
      this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed
      approval of all changes.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>This privacy policy is effective as of 2024-06-12</p>
    <br /><strong>Your Consent</strong>
    <p>
      By using the Application, you are consenting to the processing of your
      information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by the
      Service Provider.
